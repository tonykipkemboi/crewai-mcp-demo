# Building Wall Street-Grade Regulatory Intelligence with CrewAI and Snowflake MCP

**How to Create an AI-Powered Regulatory Monitoring System That Delivers $100K+ Analyst Reports in Minutes**

---

## The Problem: Regulatory Intelligence at Scale

Asset managers and institutional investors face a critical challenge: **staying ahead of regulatory changes** that could impact their portfolios. When the FDA announces a new drug regulation or the SEC updates filing requirements, fund managers need answers to critical questions:

- Which portfolio companies are affected?
- What's the financial impact and timeline?
- How are markets reacting?
- What should our investment strategy be?

Traditional approaches require armies of analysts, weeks of research, and often miss critical insights buried in SEC filings or market sentiment. **The cost? $50,000-$100,000 per comprehensive regulatory impact analysis.**

## The Solution: AI-Powered Regulatory Intelligence

We've built a **3-agent AI system** that combines CrewAI's multi-agent orchestration with Snowflake's powerful data infrastructure to deliver institutional-grade regulatory analysis in minutes, not weeks.

### 🏗️ **System Architecture**

```

**Agent 1**: Analyzes regulatory announcements and gathers intelligence  
**Agent 2**: Searches 372,299 SEC filings for affected companies and risk patterns  
**Agent 3**: Researches market sentiment and produces final investment-grade report  

## Real-World Example: FDA Salt Substitutes Regulation

Let's walk through a real analysis of **FDA RIN 0910-AI72** - a proposed rule allowing salt substitutes in standardized foods.

### 📊 **The Results**

Our system identified:
- **3 affected companies** with quantified risk levels
- **$5.82B market opportunity** with 5.5%+ growth projections
- **Investment recommendations** with specific time horizons
- **26 monitoring metrics** for ongoing intelligence

**Generated Report Value**: Equivalent to $75,000+ institutional research report
**Time to Generate**: 3 minutes  
**Data Sources**: 372,299 SEC filings + real-time market intelligence

SNOWFLAKE_PAT=your_personal_access_token
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key
```

### Step 3: Set Up Snowflake Semantic Model

The system uses a sophisticated semantic model for SEC filing analysis:

```yaml
# snowflake_demo_config.yaml
semantic_model:
  name: "SEC_Regulatory_Intelligence"
  tables:
    - name: "sec_filings_text"
      description: "SEC filing content and metadata for regulatory analysis"
      sql: "SELECT * FROM mcp_demo.public.sec_filings_text"
      
  metrics:
    - name: "regulatory_filing_frequency"
      type: "count"
      sql: "filing_content ILIKE '%regulatory%' OR filing_content ILIKE '%FDA%'"
      
    - name: "risk_disclosure_intensity" 
      type: "average"
      sql: "LENGTH(filing_content)"
```

### Step 4: Agent Configuration

**Regulatory Intelligence Agent** (`agents.yaml`):
```yaml

```python
# crew.py - MCP configuration
mcp_server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uvx",
    args=[
        "--from", "git+https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/mcp",
        "mcp-server-snowflake",
        "--service-config-file", str(config_path),
        "--account-identifier", account,
        "--username", username,
        "--pat", pat
    ]
)
```

**Available Tools**:
